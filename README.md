# PDL-notebooks

The two Jupyter notebooks that I used for my talk to PyData London are here.  They will act as references for the code to interact with Riak through Python and PySpark.  If anyone wants the dataset and load scripts etc. to actually run the notebooks, please contact me at setheridge@basho.com.
